Description: This package provides differential expression analysis for a variety of omics data, including: RNA-seq, CAGE, miRNA-seq, HT RNAi, mRNA microarray, miRNA microarray. It is particulary useful for relatively small sample sizes, because it applies Empirical Bayes-type estimation of priors for multi-parameter shrinkage to increase power and reproducibility. Mixture and nonparametric priors are accommodated. In addition, it provides Bayesian multiplicity correction, by lfdr and BFDR estimation. It can also perform analysis of differential splicing effects within gene sets.
