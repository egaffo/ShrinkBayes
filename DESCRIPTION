Description: This package provides differential expression analysis for a variety of omics data, including: RNA-seq, CAGE, miRNA-seq, HT RNAi, mRNA microarray, miRNA microarray. It is particulary useful for relatively small sample sizes, because it applies Empirical Bayes-type estimation of priors for multi-parameter shrinkage to increase power and reproducibility. Mixture and nonparametric priors are accommodated. In addition, it provides Bayesian multiplicity correction, by lfdr and BFDR estimation.
